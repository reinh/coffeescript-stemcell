**CoffeeScript StemCell** provides a basic static site with CoffeeScript and
Stylus. Testing is provided by Jasmine. Grunt manages all the tasks.

`grunt watch`:: compiles your CoffeeScript and Stylus and runs your Jasmine
specs on the fly.

`grunt coffee`:: compiles CoffeeScript files in `coffee/lib/` into `app/lib.js`
and `coffee/js/app.coffee` into `app/js/app.js`.

`grunt stylus`:: compiles `stylus/app.styl` into `app/css/app.css`.

`grunt spec`:: compiles your CoffeeScript files in `coffee/lib/` and run their
specs in `spec/lib/`
